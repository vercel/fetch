# Fetch Monorepo

This is the official Vercel fetch monorepo

## Getting Started

`@vercel/fetch` bundles all packages inside this monorepo together into a super-powered [fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) client. By default, this package will use its peer dependency [node-fetch](https://github.com/node-fetch/node-fetch), but it also supports other fetch implementations.

```js
// Basic Usage
import fetch from '@vercel/fetch';
```

```js
// Bring your own fetch implementation
import createFetch from '@vercel/fetch';
import fetchImpl from 'some-fetch-implementation';
const fetch = createFetch(fetchImpl);
```
